# LLM Deployment Examples

This directory contains examples and reference implementations for deploying Large Language Models (LLMs) in various configurations.

## Components

- workers: Prefill and decode worker handles actual LLM inference
- router: Handles API requests and routes them to appropriate workers based on specified strategy
- frontend: OpenAI compatible http server handles incoming requests

## Deployment Architectures

### Aggregated
Single-instance deployment where both prefill and decode are done by the same worker.

### Disaggregated
Distributed deployment where prefill and decode are done by separate workers that can scale independently.

    participant D as VllmWorker
    participant Q as PrefillQueue
    participant P as PrefillWorker

    Note over D: Request is routed to decode
    D->>D: Decide if prefill should be done locally or remotely

        D->>D: Allocate KV blocks
        D->>Q: Put RemotePrefillRequest on the queue

        P->>Q: Pull request from the queue
        P-->>D: Read cached KVs from Decode

        D->>D: Decode other requests
        P->>P: Run prefill
        P-->>D: Write prefilled KVs into allocated blocks
        P->>D: Send completion notification
        Note over D: Notification received when prefill is done
        D->>D: Schedule decoding
```

## Getting Started

1. Choose a deployment architecture based on your requirements
2. Configure the components as needed
3. Deploy using the provided scripts

### Prerequisites

Start required services (etcd and NATS) using [Docker Compose](../../deploy/metrics/docker-compose.yml)
```bash
docker compose -f deploy/metrics/docker-compose.yml up -d
```

### Build docker

```bash
# On an x86 machine
./container/build.sh --framework vllm

# On an ARM machine (ex: GB200)
./container/build.sh --framework vllm --platform linux/arm64
```

> [!NOTE]
> Building a vLLM docker image for ARM machines currently involves building vLLM from source,
> which has known issues with being slow and requiring a lot of system RAM:
> https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/issues/8878
>
> You can tune the number of parallel build jobs for building VLLM from source
> on ARM based on your available cores and system RAM with `VLLM_MAX_JOBS`.
>
> For example, on an ARM machine with low system resources:
> `./container/build.sh --framework vllm --platform linux/arm64 --build-arg VLLM_MAX_JOBS=2`
>
> For example, on a GB200 which has very high CPU cores and memory resource:
> `./container/build.sh --framework vllm --platform linux/arm64 --build-arg VLLM_MAX_JOBS=64`
>
> When vLLM has pre-built ARM wheels published, this process can be improved.

### Run container

```
./container/run.sh -it --framework vllm
```

## Run Deployment

> [!NOTE]
> The planner component is enabled by default for all deployment architectures but is set to no-op mode. This means the planner observes metrics but doesn't take scaling actions. To enable active scaling, you can add `--Planner.no-operation=false` to your `dynamo serve` command. For more details, see the [Planner documentation](../../components/planner/README.md).

### Example architectures
_Note_: For a non-dockerized deployment, first export `DYNAMO_HOME` to point to the dynamo repository root, e.g. `export DYNAMO_HOME=$(pwd)`

#### Aggregated serving
```bash
cd $DYNAMO_HOME/examples/llm
dynamo serve graphs.agg:Frontend -f ./configs/agg.yaml
```

#### Aggregated serving with KV Routing
```bash
cd $DYNAMO_HOME/examples/llm
dynamo serve graphs.agg_router:Frontend -f ./configs/agg_router.yaml
```

#### Disaggregated serving
```bash
cd $DYNAMO_HOME/examples/llm
dynamo serve graphs.disagg:Frontend -f ./configs/disagg.yaml
```

#### Disaggregated serving with KV Routing
```bash
cd $DYNAMO_HOME/examples/llm
dynamo serve graphs.disagg_router:Frontend -f ./configs/disagg_router.yaml
```

### Client

In another terminal:
```bash
# this test request has around 200 tokens isl

curl localhost:8000/v1/chat/completions   -H "Content-Type: application/json"   -d '{
    "model": "deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B",
    "messages": [
    {
        "role": "user",
        "content": "In the heart of Eldoria, an ancient land of boundless magic and mysterious creatures, lies the long-forgotten city of Aeloria. Once a beacon of knowledge and power, Aeloria was buried beneath the shifting sands of time, lost to the world for centuries.

    }
    ],
    "stream":false,
    "max_tokens": 30
  }'

```

### Multi-node deployment

See [multinode-examples.md](multinode-examples.md) for more details.

### Close deployment

See [close deployment](../../docs/guides/dynamo_serve.md#close-deployment) section to learn about how to close the deployment.

## Deploy to Kubernetes

These examples can be deployed to a Kubernetes cluster using [Dynamo Cloud](../../docs/guides/dynamo_deploy/dynamo_cloud.md) and the Dynamo CLI.

### Prerequisites

You must have first followed the instructions in [deploy/cloud/helm/README.md](../../deploy/cloud/helm/README.md) to install Dynamo Cloud on your Kubernetes cluster.

**Note**: The `KUBE_NS` variable in the following steps must match the Kubernetes namespace where you installed Dynamo Cloud. You must also expose the `dynamo-store` service externally. This will be the endpoint the CLI uses to interface with Dynamo Cloud.

### Deployment Steps

For detailed deployment instructions, please refer to the [Operator Deployment Guide](../../docs/guides/dynamo_deploy/operator_deployment.md). The following are the specific commands for the LLM examples:

```bash
# Set your project root directory
export PROJECT_ROOT=$(pwd)

# Configure environment variables (see operator_deployment.md for details)
export KUBE_NS=dynamo-cloud
export DYNAMO_CLOUD=http://localhost:8080  # If using port-forward
# OR
# export DYNAMO_CLOUD=https://dynamo-cloud.nvidia.com  # If using Ingress/VirtualService

# Build the Dynamo base image (see operator_deployment.md for details)
export DYNAMO_IMAGE=<your-registry>/<your-image-name>:<your-tag>

# Build the service
cd $PROJECT_ROOT/examples/llm
DYNAMO_TAG=$(dynamo build graphs.agg:Frontend | grep "Successfully built" |  awk '{ print $NF }' | sed 's/\.$//')

# Deploy to Kubernetes
export DEPLOYMENT_NAME=llm-agg
dynamo deployment create $DYNAMO_TAG -n $DEPLOYMENT_NAME -f ./configs/agg.yaml
```

**Note**: Optionally add `--Planner.no-operation=false` at the end of the deployment command to enable the planner component to take scaling actions on your deployment.

### Testing the Deployment

Once the deployment is complete, you can test it using:

```bash
# Find your frontend pod
export FRONTEND_POD=$(kubectl get pods -n ${KUBE_NS} | grep "${DEPLOYMENT_NAME}-frontend" | sort -k1 | tail -n1 | awk '{print $1}')

# Forward the pod's port to localhost
kubectl port-forward pod/$FRONTEND_POD 8000:8000 -n ${KUBE_NS}

# Test the API endpoint
curl localhost:8000/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B",
    "messages": [
    {
        "role": "user",
        "content": "In the heart of Eldoria, an ancient land of boundless magic and mysterious creatures, lies the long-forgotten city of Aeloria. Once a beacon of knowledge and power, Aeloria was buried beneath the shifting sands of time, lost to the world for centuries.

    }
    ],
    "stream":false,
    "max_tokens": 30
  }'
```
