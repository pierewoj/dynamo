# Multinode Examples

## Single node sized models
You can deploy dynamo on multiple nodes via NATS/ETCD based discovery and communication. Here's an example of deploying disaggregated serving on 3 nodes using `nvidia/Llama-3.1-405B-Instruct-FP8`. Each node must be properly configured with Infiniband and/or RoCE for communication between decode and prefill workers.

##### Disaggregated Deployment with KV Routing
- Node 1: Frontend, Processor, Router, Decode Worker
- Node 2: Prefill Worker
- Node 3: Prefill Worker

Note that this can be easily extended to more nodes. You can also run the Frontend, Processor, and Router on a separate CPU only node if you'd like as long as all nodes have access to the NATS/ETCD endpoints!

**Step 1**: Start NATS/ETCD on your head node. Ensure you have the correct firewall rules to allow communication between the nodes the NATS/ETCD endpoints must be accessible by all other nodes.
```bash
# node 1
docker compose -f deploy/metrics/docker-compose.yml up -d
```

**Step 2**: Create the inference graph for this node. Here we use the `agg_router.py` (even though we are doing disaggregated serving) graph because we want the `Frontend`, `Processor`, `Router`, and `VllmWorker` to spin up (we spin up the other decode worker and prefill worker separately on different nodes later).

```python
# graphs/agg_router.py
Frontend.link(Processor).link(Router).link(VllmWorker)
```

**Step 3**: Create a configuration file for this node. We've provided a sample one for you in `configs/multinode-405b.yaml` for the 405B model. Note that we still include the `PrefillWorker` component in the configuration file even though we are not using it on node 1. This is because we can reuse the same configuration file on all nodes and just spin up individual workers on the other ones.

**Step 4**: Start the frontend, processor, router, and VllmWorker on node 1.
```bash
# node 1
cd $DYNAMO_HOME/examples/llm
dynamo serve graphs.agg_router:Frontend -f ./configs/multinode-405b.yaml
```

**Step 5**: Start the first prefill worker on node 2.
Since we only want to start the `PrefillWorker` on node 2, you can simply run just the PrefillWorker component directly with the configuration file from before.

```bash
# node 2
export NATS_SERVER = '<your-nats-server-address>' # note this should start with nats://...
export ETCD_ENDPOINTS = '<your-etcd-endpoints-address>'

cd $DYNAMO_HOME/examples/llm
dynamo serve components.prefill_worker:PrefillWorker -f ./configs/multinode-405b.yaml
```

**Step 6**: Start the second prefill worker on node 3.
```bash
# node 3
export NATS_SERVER = '<your-nats-server-address>' # note this should start with nats://...
export ETCD_ENDPOINTS = '<your-etcd-endpoints-address>'

cd $DYNAMO_HOME/examples/llm
dynamo serve components.prefill_worker:PrefillWorker -f ./configs/multinode-405b.yaml
```

**Step 7**: [Optional] Start more decode workers on other nodes
This example can be extended to more nodes as well. For example, if you want to spin up another decode worker, you can use
```bash
# node X
export NATS_SERVER = '<your-nats-server-address>' # note this should start with nats://...
export ETCD_ENDPOINTS = '<your-etcd-endpoints-address>'

cd $DYNAMO_HOME/examples/llm
dynamo serve components.worker:VllmWorker -f ./configs/multinode-405b.yaml --service-name VllmWorker
```

Note the use of `--service-name`. This only spins up the worker that you are requesting and ignore any `depends` statements.

```

#### Multi-node sized models

Multinode model support is coming soon. You can track progress [here](https://github.com/ai-dynamo/dynamo/issues/513)!

##### Aggregated Deployment

The steps for aggregated deployment of multi-node sized models is similar to
single-node sized models, except that you need to first configure the nodes
to be interconnected according to the framework's multi-node deployment guide.
In the below example, vLLM is be used as the framework to serve `DeepSeek-R1` model
using tensor parallel 16 on two H100x8 nodes.

**Step 1**: On each of the nodes, set up Ray cluster so that vLLM can access the resource
collectively:
```bash
# head node
ray start --head --port=6379

# example output and keep note of the IP address of the head node
# Local node IP: <head-node-address>

# set vLLM env arg
export VLLM_HOST_IP=<head-node-address>

# other node
ray start  --address=<head-node-address>:6379
export VLLM_HOST_IP=<current-node-address>

# verify the accessibility by checking aggregated GPU count shown in ray status
ray status

# Expected/Sample output for 2 nodes:
# ```bash
# ======== Autoscaler status: 2025-04-16 15:35:42.751688 ========
# Node status
# ---------------------------------------------------------------
# Active:
#  1 node_<hash_1>
#  1 node_<hash_2>
# Pending:
#  (no pending nodes)
# Recent failures:
#  (no failures)
# Resources
# ---------------------------------------------------------------
# Usage:
# XXX CPU
# XXX GPU
# XXX memory
# XXX object_store_memory
# Demands:
#  (no resource demands)
```

**Step 2**: On the head node, follow [LLM deployment examples](https://github.com/ai-dynamo/dynamo/blob/main/examples/llm/README.md) to
setup dynamo deployment for aggregated serving, using the configuration file,
`configs/multinode_agg_r1.yaml`, for DeepSeek-R1:
```bash
cd $DYNAMO_HOME/examples/llm
dynamo serve graphs.agg:Frontend -f ./configs/multinode_agg_r1.yaml
```

###### Client

In another terminal, you can send the same curl request as described above but
with `"model": "deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1"`
```bash
# this test request has around 200 tokens isl

curl <node1-ip>:8000/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Accept: text/event-stream" \
  -d '{
    "model": "deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1",
    "messages": [
      {
        "role": "user",
        "content": "In the heart of Eldoria, an ancient land of boundless magic and mysterious creatures, lies the long-forgotten city of Aeloria. Once a beacon of knowledge and power, Aeloria was buried beneath the shifting sands of time, lost to the world for centuries.

      }
    ],
    "stream": true,
    "max_tokens": 300
  }'
```

##### Disaggregated Deployment

In this example, we deploy two replicas of the model (one prefill worker
and one decode worker). We use 4 H100x8 nodes and group every two of them
into one Ray cluster in the same way as described in aggregated deployment.
However, for etcd and nats server, we only run them in
one node and let's consider that node to be the head node of the whole deployment.

Note that if you are starting etcd server directly instead of using `docker compose`,
you should add additional arguments to be discoverable in other node.
```bash
etcd --advertise-client-urls http://<head-node-ip>:2379 --listen-client-urls http://<head-node-ip>:2379,http://127.0.0.1:2379
```

**Step 1**: On every two nodes, set up Ray cluster as described in
[aggregated deployment](#aggregated-deployment). After that, you should have
two independent Ray cluster, each has access to 16 GPUs.

**Step 2** start the deployment by running different flavors of `dynamo serve`
on one of the node for each Ray cluster, using the configuration file,
`configs/mutinode_disagg_r1.yaml`.

For decode, the below command is used; the node is the entry point of
the whole deployment. In other words, the ip of the node should be used to send
requests to.
```bash
# if not head node
export NATS_SERVER='nats://<nats-server-ip>:4222'
export ETCD_ENDPOINTS='<etcd-endpoints-ip>:2379'

cd $DYNAMO_HOME/examples/llm
dynamo serve graphs.agg:Frontend -f ./configs/mutinode_disagg_r1.yaml
```

For prefill:
```bash
# if not head node
export NATS_SERVER='nats://<nats-server-ip>:4222'
export ETCD_ENDPOINTS='<etcd-endpoints-ip>:2379'

cd $DYNAMO_HOME/examples/llm
dynamo serve components.prefill_worker:PrefillWorker -f ./configs/mutinode_disagg_r1.yaml
```

###### Client

In another terminal, you can send the same curl request as described in
[aggregated deployment](#aggregated-deployment), addressing to the ip of
the decode node.
